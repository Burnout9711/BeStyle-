<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed BeStyle.AI from an MVP to a highly refined, cinematic web application. Initial efforts focused on comprehensive frontend design, incorporating 3D effects, animations, and a dark theme. Concurrently, a robust FastAPI backend with MongoDB was built and thoroughly tested, ensuring core functionalities like quiz, recommendations, and waitlist worked. A significant phase involved integrating the frontend and backend, successfully replacing all mock data. Subsequent work was driven by iterative design feedback, enhancing 3D card effects and refining overall animations for a smoother, more sophisticated user experience. Finally, the application underwent a major transformation to a scroll-based cinematic landing page, meticulously designed to match a  aesthetic, including specific content, animations, and responsive layouts. Persistent caching issues reported by the user were identified and addressed through service restarts and user-side cache clearing instructions.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an AI-powered fashion website, BeStyle.AI, providing outfit suggestions. The MVP features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Initial frontend requirements emphasized a conversion-optimized design, 3D effects, interactive animations, and a waitlist CTA, initially with a warm cream theme. This evolved to a modern dark theme, advanced 3D enhancements (parallax, interactive avatar, particle effects), AI integration, user authentication, social sharing, and complex quiz logic. The landing page was restructured to include Hero, Launch Teaser, Quiz Introduction, Waitlist, and Feature Highlights. Backend requirements included API contracts, MongoDB models for quiz, sessions, waitlist, and recommendations, and an AI recommendation engine. The most recent major requirement was a complete overhaul to a scroll-based, immersive, cinematic landing page inspired by , with specific content for six sections, custom typography, and nuanced scroll-triggered animations.

<current_work>
The application, BeStyle.AI, has been transformed into a visually stunning, immersive, scroll-based cinematic landing page, meticulously designed to match the  aesthetic. All frontend mock data and  usage have been replaced with real API calls, fully integrating with the robust FastAPI backend.

The current  component orchestrates all sections:
1.  **Hero Section**: Displays AI Meets Your Closet. with a subheading and â†’ Take the Quiz CTA button. It features a gradient background with subtle animations.
2.  **Storytelling Section**: Reveals Tired of outfit confusion?, AI learns your style â€” and evolves with you., and Your closet now thinks with you. with scroll-triggered fade-ins and background motion.
3.  **Interactive Quiz Preview**: Presents âœ¨ Discover Your Look in 60 Seconds with a mobile mockup displaying actual quiz questions and a â†’ Start Styling Me button.
4.  **Why BeStyle**: Highlights Smarter Than a Stylist with four feature cards (Personality-Based Matching, Plans-Based Suggestions, Closet Upload (coming soon), Daily New Styles) that have subtle hover effects.
5.  **Waitlist Section**: Features ðŸ”’ Join the Early Access List with email, Instagram handle, and a checkbox, integrated with the backend API.
6.  **Footer**: Minimalistic with links and social icons.

Key visual and interactive elements, such as the  component, have been refined for subtle and smooth 3D effects on hover and scroll, providing a premium feel without being exaggerated. All CTA buttons have refined glow/pulse hover effects. The application is fully mobile-responsive, optimized for performance, and all backend integrations (quiz flow, waitlist) have been verified through comprehensive testing. The user repeatedly reported seeing an old version, which was determined to be a browser caching issue and was actively troubleshooted by restarting the frontend service and guiding the user on cache clearing.
