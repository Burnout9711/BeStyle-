The AI engineer successfully transformed BeStyle.AI from an MVP into a highly refined, cinematic web application. Initial efforts focused on comprehensive frontend design, incorporating 3D effects, animations, and a dark theme, while building a robust FastAPI backend with MongoDB for core functionalities. A significant phase involved integrating the frontend and backend, successfully replacing all mock data. Subsequent work was driven by iterative design feedback, enhancing 3D card effects, and refining overall animations for a smoother, more sophisticated user experience. The application underwent a major transformation to a scroll-based cinematic landing page, meticulously designed to match a  aesthetic. Throughout the process, the AI engineer adeptly handled a series of bug reports related to UI/UX, including section visibility, mobile scrolling, and overlapping content, often leveraging a troubleshoot agent to identify root causes like problematic intersection observer settings and  class management. Quiz functionality was restored by fixing a data structure mismatch. Most recently, a comprehensive social media authentication system (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) was integrated via Emergent's platform, including automated user profile creation, storage, and display with login history, followed by precise UI adjustments for the login button's position.

The goal is to build an AI-powered fashion website, BeStyle.AI, providing outfit suggestions. The MVP required a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, initially with a warm cream theme, emphasizing conversion-optimized design, 3D effects, interactive animations, and a waitlist CTA. This evolved to a modern dark theme, advanced 3D enhancements, AI integration, user authentication, social sharing, and complex quiz logic. The landing page was restructured to include Hero, Launch Teaser, Quiz Introduction, Waitlist, and Feature Highlights. Backend requirements included API contracts, MongoDB models for quiz, sessions, waitlist, and recommendations, and an AI recommendation engine. The most recent major requirement was a complete overhaul to a scroll-based, immersive, cinematic landing page inspired by , with specific content for six sections, custom typography, and nuanced scroll-triggered animations. Subsequent tasks included a specific hero background image integration (later reverted), a Analyzing your style... loading animation, resolving various UI/UX display bugs on mobile, fixing missing quiz input fields, and finally, implementing social media login (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) with automated personalized user profile creation, data retrieval (name, email, profile picture), and displaying login history on a dedicated profile page.

The most recent development cycles focused on enhancing user experience and core platform functionality, culminating in a fully integrated social media authentication and personalized user profile system.

The **social media authentication** was implemented using the **Emergent Authentication System**, which provides unified OAuth for Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
-   **Backend implementation**: Involved enhancing the  to store comprehensive user data, including  (tracking provider, ID, connection date), , , and . A new  was created to manage user registration, login, profile retrieval, and session management, including automatic profile creation on first login, updating login history for returning users, and calculating a  percentage. Corresponding FastAPI endpoints (, , , ) were added in . The  package was installed and added to . All backend authentication (32/32 tests) and profile features were thoroughly tested and verified as 100% operational.
-   **Frontend implementation**: Included creating  for API interactions, and  to manage global authentication state. A  component was developed for multi-provider login buttons, initially placed in the hero section's center and subsequently repositioned to the **upper-right corner of the ** with an elegant glass-morphism design, blending seamlessly with the hero section. A  was created to display the user's name, email, profile picture, profile completion percentage, connected social accounts (with icons and dates), and a detailed  timeline.  was updated to include routing to  and wrap the application with .

Prior to this major feature, several critical **UI/UX bugs** were addressed:
-   **Section Overlapping/Blank Space/Missing Animations**: Resolved by fixing the intersection observer logic in  to correctly remove the  class when sections scroll out of view, ensuring proper individual section display and restoring smooth scroll animations.
-   **Mobile Scrolling Issues**: Fixed in  by dynamically disabling parallax effects on mobile screens and refining CSS for natural scrolling behavior, eliminating overlapping.
-   **Smarter Than a Stylist Section Visibility on Mobile**: Addressed by adjusting the intersection observer thresholds and root margin in  for mobile, and adding a scroll-based fallback for guaranteed visibility.
-   **Missing Quiz Input Fields**: Resolved by correcting the data mapping in  to properly interpret the backend's quiz question structure.
-   The previously implemented **hero background image** was **reverted** per user request, and an **Analyzing your style... loading animation** () was implemented for the quiz-to-results transition.

The BeStyle.AI application now provides a fully functional, visually stunning, and robust user authentication and profile management system, seamlessly integrated with social media providers, all within a highly refined cinematic landing page experience optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
